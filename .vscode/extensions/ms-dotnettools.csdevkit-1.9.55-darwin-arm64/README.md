# C# Dev Kit for Visual Studio Code
C# Dev Kit helps you manage your code with a solution explorer and test your code with integrated unit test discovery and execution, elevating your C# development experience wherever you like to develop (Windows, macOS, Linux, and even in a Codespace).

This extension builds on top of the great C# language capabilities provided by the [C# extension][CSharpExtension] and enhances your C# environment by adding a set of powerful tools and utilities that integrate natively with VS Code to help C# developers write, debug, and maintain their code faster and with fewer errors. Some of this new tooling includes but is not limited to:
* C# project and solution management via an integrated solution explorer
* Native testing environment to run and debug tests using the Test Explorer
* Roslyn-powered language service for best in-class C# language features such as code navigation, refactoring, semantic awareness, and more

## Quick Start
1. Install C# Dev Kit (The [C# extension][CSharpExtension] and the [.NET Install Tool](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime) will automatically be installed).
2. Open a folder/workspace that contains a C# project (.csproj) and the extension will activate, or use the ".NET: New Project..." command to create a new C# project.
3. Check out the [C# Getting Started](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/csharp/get-started) documentation to learn more!

## Installed Extensions
C# Dev Kit will automatically install the [C# extension][CSharpExtension] and [.NET Install Tool](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.vscode-dotnet-runtime) to give you the best experience when working with C#. 

## Write your project faster with AI-powered C# development
The [IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit][vscodeintellicode-csharpExtension] extension is part of C# Dev Kit family of extensions and enhances the AI-assisted support beyond the basic [IntelliSense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) code-completion found in the existing C# extension.  It includes powerful IntelliCode features such as whole-line completions and starred suggestions based on your personal codebase. To take advantage of this functionality, you will need to install [IntelliCode for C# Dev Kit][vscodeintellicode-csharpExtension].

## Working with MAUI or Unity
C# Dev Kit family of extensions is great for all cloud native development. Working with mobile (MAUI) or Unity does require the addition of other extensions that provide functionality specific to their unique components.

For MAUI development, install the [.NET MAUI Extension][MAUIExtension].
For Unity development, install the [Unity Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioToolsForUnity.vstuc).

When working with Unity, if you see this error: "The project file 'Assembly-CSharp.csproj' is in unsupported format", please update the "Visual Studio Editor" version to 2.0.20 from the Unity Package Manager.
